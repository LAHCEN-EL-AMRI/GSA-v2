# GSA v2 - Gamma Spectrum Analysis Tool

**GSA v2** is the second version of the gamma spectrum analysis tool, available at the following link: [GSA v2 on GitHub](https://github.com/LAHCEN-EL-AMRI/Gamma-spectra-analysis/tree/master).

This version retains all the functionalities of the first while introducing an option to **calculate the activity of each nuclide** present in the radioactive sample, thus facilitating result analysis.

To enhance calibration precision, four different efficiency formulas are employed. These formulas allow for adapting the measured efficiency to the specific characteristics of detectors and samples, providing users with more reliable and meaningful results.
